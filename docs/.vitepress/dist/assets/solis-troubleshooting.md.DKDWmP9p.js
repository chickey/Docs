The ID is a unique identifyer which allows you to have several inverters connected and monitored. Because of this the ID which you have set on your inverter must match the setting in your yaml file. Typically 10 is used for Solis inverters but it may have been changed by your installed. The number is hex so in the example below it is set to &quot;A&quot; and if you wanted to set ID 1 then it would be &quot;address: 0x1&quot;</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>modbus_controller:</span></span>
