Once assembled the device shall look as per below (resistor colours may vary and also the case colour may vary if you’ve ordered one) The 3D case design is on <a href="https://www.github.com/chickey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Thingiverse</a></p><p align="center" width="100%"><img src="'+o+'" alt="I sell on Tindie" width="1000" height="1000"></p><p>Once inside the case the assembled unit shall look as per below</p><p align="center" width="100%"><img src="'+s+'" alt="I sell on Tindie" width="1000" height="1000"></p><p>So enough of the end product, lets look at what the kit shall look like</p><p align="center" width="100%"><img src="'+r+'" alt="I sell on Tindie" width="1000" height="1000"></p><p>I have where possible labelled the parts in the packaging but the current shipping parts are coloured as above which makes identification easier.</p><p>Assembly notes The resistors have no polarity so can be placed in either direction. The capacitors have a polarity which can be identified in two ways. The longest leg is the positive side and also the negative side has a white strip down that side. On the PCB the positive is labelled and also the negative is shows with a white section on the circle to designate the negative. When placing the usb connectors particularly the male ensure then are pressed into the board and level. I recommend soldering one pin and then checking which will allow easy adjustment. Take care and try not to apply the heat in one location too long.</p><p align="center" width="100%"><img src="'+n+'" alt="I sell on Tindie" width="500" height="500"></p><p>Above is a diagram showing which resistors and capacitors match up to the corresponding markings on the pcb.</p>',11),c=[l];function p(d,u,f,g,_,w){return a(),t("div",null,c)}const y=e(h,[["render",p]]);export{v as __pageData,y as default};
