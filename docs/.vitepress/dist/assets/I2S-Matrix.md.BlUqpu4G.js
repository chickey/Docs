This is essential if you choose to solder the ESP32 directly to the board, but makes it easier even if you choose to use the header stand-offs</li><li>Ground is a plane across the whole board, so you may need to increase the heat of your iron to solder Ground pads.</li></ul><h2 id="setup-and-configuration-options" tabindex="-1">Setup and Configuration options <a class="header-anchor" href="#setup-and-configuration-options" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Setup and Configuration options&quot;">​</a></h2><h4 id="setup" tabindex="-1">Setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#setup" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Setup&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li>On most displays, there are two connectors.

Double it for a 64x64. I would also recomend allowing some head room, expecially if you are getting a cheaper supply.</li><li>It is possible to power the display through the micro-usb of the ESP32, but I would be very cautious about doing this, as it is probably not designed to handle high amounts of current.</li></ul><h4 id="power-configuration" tabindex="-1">Power Configuration <a class="header-anchor" href="#power-configuration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Power Configuration&quot;">​</a></h4><p>There is a 3pin connector with a jumper pin on the shield, this is for configuring the power setup:</p><ul><li><strong>Jumper on the bottom two pins</strong> - This should be the position you use unless you want to do something else specific. This mode allows power from your barel jack/screw terminals to power your ESP32, but will block the ESP32 from powering the display if you only have USB connected.</li><li><strong>Jumper on the top two pins &quot;diode bypass&quot;</strong> - This allows you to power the display using the USB power of the ESP32. I would be very cautious about doing this, as it is probably not designed to handle high amounts of current.</li><li><strong>Removing Jumper</strong> - If you want to power the ESP32 and the display seperately you can, removing the jumpers disconnects the 5V from the shield from the ESP32 5V pin. GND remains connected.</li></ul><h2 id="software-setup" tabindex="-1">Software Setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#software-setup" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Software Setup&quot;">​</a></h2><h4 id="board-definition" tabindex="-1">Board definition <a class="header-anchor" href="#board-definition" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Board definition&quot;">​</a></h4><p>You will need to have the ESP32 setup for your Arduino IDE, <a href="https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">instructions can be found here</a>.</p><h4 id="library-dependancies" tabindex="-1">Library dependancies <a class="header-anchor" href="#library-dependancies" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Library dependancies&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/mrfaptastic/ESP32-RGB64x32MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ESP32-RGB64x32MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA</a> - the library this shield is designed to be used with.
